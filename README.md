# MVC-Demo

A very simple but also solid example of the [MVC design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), using Java (and Swing). All code should be properly documented and commented so it easily can be used as a reference project.

### Disclaimer
There are other ways to implement MVC; this is just an implementation that I think is good.
